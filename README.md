# MSDyn365BC.Ntfy

This app is a wrapper around https://ntfy.sh - an open source notification service.

The goal of this app is to let users setup notification for various "events" in Buisness Central, notifying them, when the action is finished.

Example:
You schedule a number of invoices for background posting and want to know when it finished. 
Just setup a notification and you will get a push notification to your phone.

Another example:
You have a report that you need to print out every week but it takes 15 minutes to render.
Setup a notification so you know when you need to finish your coffee break ;)
